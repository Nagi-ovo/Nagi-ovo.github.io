  MemoMusic 3.0 enhances personalized music recommendation by considering the music listening context, and improves music generation by introducing music theory. The system considers how context affects listeners' emotional states and incorporates music theory knowledge for better generation. Using a Transformer-based framework trained on Classic, Pop, and Yanni music, it generates music based on dominant melodies with target emotional values while following music theory principles. Experimental results show improved emotional impact and user satisfaction.
